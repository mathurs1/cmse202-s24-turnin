Given the goal of maximizing accuracy while minimizing the number of features, I would choose four PCA components. This choice balances a high accuracy (around 74.63%) with a substantial yet not complete feature reduction, capturing about 81.54% of the total variance, thus providing an effective compromise between model simplicity and predictive power."

While the Perceptron's performance is now closer to that of the SVC, particularly with fewer features or PCA-transformed features, it still generally does worse compared to the optimized SVC models, which typically offer more robust handling of complex decision boundaries thanks to their ability to work effectively in higher-dimensional spaces."
